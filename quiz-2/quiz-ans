ANGULAR:
1. Explain what is controller in MVC?
Model–view–controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides an application into three interconnected parts. 
The "controller" is responsible for responding to the user input and perform interactions on the data model objects. The controller receives the input, it validates the input and then performs the business operation that modifies the state of the data model.

2. What directive is used to initialize an angular app?
The "ng-app" directive initializes an AngularJS application.

3. Can an HTML page have multiple “ng-app” directive for bootstrapping multiple AngularJS application?
The "ng-app" directive defines the root element of an AngularJS application, and it will auto-bootstrap (automatically initialize) the application when a web page is loaded.
Since, “ng-app” directive is the root element, we are not supposed to have multiple ones. But, we can use angular.bootstrap().

4. What does the The ng-bind directive used for binding?
The HTML container where the AngularJS application is displayed, is called the view.
The view has access to the model, and there are several ways of displaying model data in the view.
The ng-bind directive, which will bind the innerHTML of the element to the specified model property:

5. What is $scope?
The "$scope" is the binding part between the HTML (view) and the JavaScript (controller).
The "$scope" is an object with the available properties and methods.
The "$scope" is available for both the view and the controller.
So we can pass the "$scope" object as an argument to the controller.

6. Which module is required for routing?
The "ngRoute" module.
